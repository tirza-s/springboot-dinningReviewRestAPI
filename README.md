# springboot-dinningReviewRestAPI

In This project I build the back-end for Dinning Review web application using REST API and Spring Boot

The Objective are :
- Admin can create, update and delete the restaurant
- User can createn updatate and delete the review based on the restaurant ID

The tech stacks I use for this application : 
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL Database
- HTML (very basic)
- JavaScript (to fetch the data's from database)

I believe there are lots of things could be improve for this application and I plan to keep builing this project.
